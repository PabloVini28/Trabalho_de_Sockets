## Remarks: 📝

- Developed for the Computer Networks course at UFC - Campus de Quixadá.

- The assignment involves enabling two computers to exchange information via TCP connection using an IP address and a port.

- The Server Host must compile and start the server, then the Client Host must compile and connect to the server, remembering that it must have the IP of the server and both must have the same set port.

- In this example, the area of a plot of land is calculated, but the functions can be modified to the user's preference.
